                - <em>1,868-meter (6,129 ft)</em>-tall peak, second highest peak in <em>Kerala</em>, situated in Thiruvananthapuram district. <br>
                - trek to the peak to and fro is around 50km, passing through many types of vegetation <br>
                - home to approx <em>2000 rare medicinal herbs</em> <br>
                - Saint Agastya one of the Saptarishis is believed to be abode on the top. <br><br><img src="blog/854788e016d6d412e26936c10355138eb481efcd.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br><br>
     The above stats were more than enough for our group to attempt a trek to this trekker's paradise. Five of us boarded a train to Thiruvananthapuram on a Friday evening, stayed in a lodge near Thampanoor railway station. Next day with our group's 6th member we reached <strong>Bonacaud</strong>, where forest officials gave instructions and arranged 2 guides for us. <br>
 After parking our vehicle at the starting point, we got our things together, grabbed a staff and marched off at around 12, which was late by usual standards. <br><br><img src="blog/d8c3a652a0a28f392b4f3f216a8714dcfbadb2cd.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br><br>
     We strolled through the forest floors, cracking jokes and pulling each others leg, meanwhile guides kept urging us to walk faster as we had to reach base camp in <strong>Athirumala</strong>(17 km) before daylight was gone. Within a flash our lone food supply "bananas" were over,but our enthu was high which kept us walking. <br><br><img src="blog/6d56f0d47e06c8719fdb09c9bfa71fd9ebaae1cb.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br><br>
  We hardly noticed the change in vegetation, trees were becoming taller and bigger as we passed onto denser forests and our path became trails alongside the hills. At every turn a waterfall seemed waiting for us, between all this we shared camaraderie with <strong>leeches</strong>. Then a nice waterfront came and we all jumped in, everyone showed off their leech bites as medallions, guides were at a distance with cautious eyes towards the surroundings. <br><br><br><img src="blog/d48cb42209868d0970fb712b80e5c83757e8e52f.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br><br>
  We then proceeded to the warmer "<strong>grasslands</strong>". Since it was cloudy, heat was on a lesser side, still we felt exhausted, as our trail was becoming steeper. Our summit was visible, but the colossal size of the mountain ranges in front made us look so small, that we wondered if we could ever make it. <br><br><img src="blog/5ea2c7c762ca24fb3d1102b827ee1d1c5494b855.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br><br>
    After grasslands, final hike to our base camp was full of rocks, and we were hopping on them. Even as we went higher this array of boulders didn't seem to end. <br>
As we came closer to the base camp, we hastened through sacred areas of tribal people, the air had an eerie feeling there. Then came our base camp, there were huts made of bamboo, one of which was our stay for the night. We devoured on food prepared by our guides, then laid down in our sleeping bags, hearing growls and howls in between from the forest outside the camp perimeter. As the skies were clear, our hut was lit up with moonlight coming from the small openings in roof. <br><br><img src="blog/ad0eb01a83a3b635b2479d1a926a6f3e20f9f5a7.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br>
           Next morning we had our fill, and went ahead at around 7 am. Our initial hike was through the "<strong>A/C vanam</strong>". A common notion is that few hours spent here will make you immune to most of the diseases for next 3-4 weeks, as the place is filled with rare medicinal plants, which makes the air filled with curative aroma, and honestly we all were fit as fiddle for a month.Next were the <strong>bamboo forests</strong> and guides instructed us to move fast, as jumbos didn't like anyone roaming in their food pastures.The climb that followed, was in such a way that our knees kissed our chest while going up. <br><br><img src="blog/fe3abd6693f64c35734ca60e6e77ee14cdae4ff3.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br><br>
     Finally we saw an opening, where ropes were lying ahead of us to assist in the almost vertical climb, we were a bit taken aback as wind also was so strong, that there was sense of being blown away. Till now the hike was physically demanding, but now it was becoming a bit scary too. After climbing using three such ropes, we finally set foot on the peak at around 1030 am. To our despair peak was still covered under mist, and we couldn't see a thing but the small shrine of Saint Agastya, we checked the altitude which showed 1863 meters. <br><br><img src="blog/2e15336d8fae858ddef7a101a9b4fddd2128e72b.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br><br><br><img src="blog/a5f59d07ecd62cf4c4a19a480927963b7537e094.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br>
    Everyone sat quiet and soaked in the moment, seemingly disconnected from everything, imprinting those peaceful moments in their hearts. As we started our descent, sun finally showed up and the mist cleared, and we were enthralled to actually see where we all were standing, it was speechless, clouds were flowing below us. <br><br><img src="blog/54af4da7c16488d9cfdf2d322307e91b6d6172b1.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br>
     We rolled down pretty fast, reached the camp at around 1:30 pm had our lunch and left the camp.Guides shared their experiences of wildlife encounters, and asked us to hurry up as once the day light was gone, the wildlife that comes out wouldn't enjoy our company. At one point they were extremely cautious, sensing a herd of elephants right ahead of us, luckily our paths didn't cross with any. After a while we witnessed a beautiful sunset, but then darkness was also growing, remaining distance was covered using torches. At last we reached our starting point,thanked our guides, and left for Thiruvananthapuram. <br><br>
        Recalling this trip fills me with a sense of pride, as me and my friends were able to scale a peak, which is still unknown to many, and even if known, yet to be explored by many.<br><br><img src="blog/8f0e319bad3e1f58eb9176ab590925133defcab9.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br><br>
           Our gang has got a common feeling now, and this quote by Nelson Mandela phrases it accurately,<br><blockquote>
             "After climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb." <br><br><img src="blog/7a31e5d66f96b2577318036f51be565c2d66191c.jpg" alt="Image description not specified." data-caption=""><br>
